Fly the vehicle in a 50m square path, using the SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command 
and specifying a target position (rather than controlling movement using velocity vectors). 
The command is called from goto_position_target_local_ned() (via `goto`).

The position is specified in terms of the NED (North East Down) relative to the Home location.

WARNING: The "D" in NED means "Down". Using a positive D value will drive the vehicle into the ground!

The code sleeps for a time (DURATION) to give the vehicle time to reach each position (rather than 
sending commands based on proximity).

The code also sets the region of interest (MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI) via the `set_roi()` method. This points the 
camera gimbal at the the selected location (in this case it aligns the whole vehicle to point at the ROI).
